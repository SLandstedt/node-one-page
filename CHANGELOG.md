## 2.0.0

Big refactoring. Highlights:

* Open source!
* A theme system with a base theme (based on the new [tema module](https://www.npmjs.org/package/tema)) 
* A new database system with programmatic schema setup and migrations (based on the [Knex.js module](http://knexjs.org/))
* A new _blocks_ feature, based on [Sir Trevor](http://madebymany.github.io/sir-trevor-js/), enabling a more flexible creation of a one-pager through the adding of simple blocks
* User roles â€“ making it possible to control access to advanced features to only administrators and leave editors with a simple non-cluttered interface
